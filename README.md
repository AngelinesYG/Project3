Project 3 by Angelines YaportGarcia and Christopher Nugroho

About the app:
This app is created with traveller in mind.

This is a travel blog where friends can post, share and edit their travel picture, add description, add rating.

This app also have weather checker capability where user can type the city and it will show the current weather & humidity from 3rd party API (Open weather)

Some of the styling are done using bootstrap.

Future Improvement:
1. Log in function where user can leave message and it will show who left the message and only can delete their own post.
2. 7 days forecast weather instead of current weather only.
3. Google map where you can see the location in the app.
4. A real rating system where you can drag the rating from 1 - 5.


Workflow:
We pair-programmed the whole apps, 1 person driving and the other dictating/researching and we took turn so both of us have the chance to practice the logic, researching and coding.
