Project 3 by Angelines YaportGarcia and Christopher Nugroho

About the app:
This app is created with a traveller's ideas in mind. Thinking that travellers often don't really know or can't decide on where to take their next vacation. So this could be something to look at that will help make a decision by looking at what others have to say about the different places.

This Travel blog allows people to post, share and edit their travel by posting pictures, adding a description, and even adding a rating.

This app also has a weather checker capability, where the user can type the city of choice and it will show the current weather & humidity, which is pulling from a from 3rd party API (Open weather)

Some of the styling are done using bootstrap.

Future Improvement:
1. Log in function where user can leave message and it will show who left the message and only can delete their own post.
2. 7 days forecast weather instead of current weather only. As well as other weather features, like air quality, wind speeds, etc.
3. Google map where you can see the location in the app.
4. A real rating system where you can drag the rating from 1 - 5.


Workflow:
We divided the back end between the two of us, each working on a different file for the back end. Chris worked on the routes, while Angie worked on the seed file and schema.
For the front end, we both felt we needed more practice with REACT, so both came together and agreed to pair-program the REACT portion. One person driving the keyboard and the other dictating/researching. We also took turns in the programming and bug hunting so that both of us had the chance to practice the logic, researching ways of improvement as well as problem solving, and mostly the coding itself.
For the CSS we pair programmed it at as well. It just seemed more logical to do it that way because we left it for last and both wanted to contribute and arrive at a design that we both liked. So it made more sense to do it together while on a zoom call so that we could see the page as each style changed and give feedback on what may or may not look better.

Additionally, we did face a lot of error and even conflicts. That probably was one of the biggest learning experiences for both of us because some errors didn't make any sense while others were very clear, yet hard to fix. We both were extra proud of ourselves because we were able to fix all our bugs and conflicts on our own. The only time we asked for help was once with the API because for some reason it wasn't letting up pull the temperature from it. This was extremely weird because the temperature key was in an object and we were able to pull the other keys in the same object, but for some odd reason, not the temperature. In the end we ended up using the "feels_like" key because we just could not figure out why it wasn't letting us access the "temp".

Lastly, we enjoyed working together and had a good flow and understanding of what we were doing and dividing the tasks, even when we were peer programing. We were able to work effectively and maintain a lot of communication throughout the process and making sure that each or our ideas and styles were reflected in this project.
